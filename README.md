# Picturithm
An algorithm visualizer that uses any image to visualize various algorithms. 



Wanted to review algoritmns but get tired of the bars and graphs. Well why not use your own pictures? 

Picturithmn ueses your images to do various algorithmns and normalizes them in real-time. 

So far, Picturithmn has bubble sort, picture sort, insertion sort, shell sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
