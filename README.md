# Picturithm
An algorithm visualizer that uses any image to visualize various algorithms. 



Wanted to review algoritmns but get tired of the bars and graphs. Well why not use your own pictures? 

Picturithm uses your images to do various algorithms and normalizes them in real-time. 

So far, Picturithm has bubble sort, picture sort, insertion sort, shell sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
